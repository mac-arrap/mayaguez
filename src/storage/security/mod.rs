//! Security can be managed by two parts: hardware enclaves or software enclaves.
//!
//! Enclaves are assumed to be specialized crypto modules, usually in hardware,
//! that have been audited for compliance and security. These should be used
//! for key storage and crypto operations to better protect against side channel
//! attacks and key extraction methods. The downside to hardware enclaves is portability.
//! Private keys usually cannot be removed from the enclave and thus presents a
//! problem for backup and recovery. Keys that need to backup and recovery
//! should not be stored solely in hardware enclaves. Instead, use the hardware to
//! wrap/unwrap those keys.
//!
//! Software enclaves usually do not provide the same guarantees as hardware but
//! have the flexibility of portability and deployment. The best approach is use
//! a combination of these two to create an optimal solution.
//!
//! For example, use the software enclave provided by the operating system to
//! store credentials to the hardware or external enclave. Once the credentials
//! are retrieved from the OS enclave, they can be used to connect to the
//! hardware or external enclave.
